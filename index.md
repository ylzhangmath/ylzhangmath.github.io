Welcome to my homepage!

I am currently a PhD candidate in the School of Mathematical Sciences and Institute of Natural Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, majoring in computational mathematics.

My advisors are Prof. Wenjun Ying and Prof. Weizhu Bao. My research mostly focus on the computational methods and analysis for geometric flows.
